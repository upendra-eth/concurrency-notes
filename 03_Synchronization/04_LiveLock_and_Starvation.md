### Livelock and Starvation
Livelock and starvation are issues related to synchronization that hinder thread progress.

#### Livelock:
- Threads keep changing states in response to each other but cannot proceed.
- **Example**: Two threads repeatedly yielding to each other.

#### Starvation:
- A thread waits indefinitely for resources due to scheduling priorities.
- **Example**: A low-priority thread blocked by high-priority threads.

#### Solutions:
- **For Livelock**:
  - Use randomized backoff or other strategies to break repetitive behavior.
- **For Starvation**:
  - Use fair scheduling algorithms (e.g., First Come First Serve, Round Robin).
  - Implement aging to gradually increase the priority of waiting threads.
