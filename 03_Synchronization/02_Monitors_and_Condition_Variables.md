### Monitors and Condition Variables
Monitors and condition variables provide high-level synchronization mechanisms for thread communication.

#### Monitors:
- A monitor is a high-level abstraction for mutual exclusion and synchronization.
- **Key Features**:
  - Encapsulates shared resources.
  - Only one thread can execute a monitor function at a time.

#### Condition Variables:
- Used within monitors to allow threads to wait for specific conditions.
- **Key Operations**:
  - `wait()`: A thread releases the lock and waits for a condition.
  - `signal()`: Wakes up one waiting thread.
  - `broadcast()`: Wakes up all waiting threads.

#### Example Use Case:
A producer-consumer problem where the producer waits if the buffer is full, and the consumer waits if the buffer is empty.
