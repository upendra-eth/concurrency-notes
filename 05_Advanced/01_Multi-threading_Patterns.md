### Multi-threading Patterns
Multi-threading patterns are design approaches that simplify concurrent programming by organizing thread interactions.

#### Key Patterns:
1. **Thread Pooling**:
   - Reuses a fixed number of threads to execute tasks.
   - Reduces thread creation overhead.
   - Example: Web servers handling multiple requests.

2. **Producer-Consumer**:
   - Producer threads generate data; consumer threads process it.
   - Synchronization achieved using queues and semaphores.

3. **Fork-Join**:
   - Tasks are divided into subtasks (forked) and recombined after execution (joined).
   - Example: Parallel algorithms like divide and conquer.

4. **Pipeline Pattern**:
   - Tasks are split into stages, with each stage running in a separate thread.
   - Example: Video encoding pipelines.

5. **Worker Pattern**:
   - A manager assigns tasks to worker threads from a task queue.
   - Example: Background task processing.

#### Best Practices:
- Minimize thread contention.
- Use thread-safe data structures.
- Prefer high-level concurrency frameworks.
