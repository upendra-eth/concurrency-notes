### Distributed Concurrency
Distributed concurrency involves managing concurrent tasks across multiple machines in a distributed system.

#### Characteristics:
- **Scalability**: Tasks can span across multiple nodes.
- **Asynchrony**: Communication and task execution are often asynchronous.

#### Challenges:
1. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Nodes may fail; systems must handle failures gracefully.
   - Solutions: Replication, retries, consensus algorithms.

2. **Data Consistency**:
   - Ensuring consistency across nodes.
   - Solutions: Distributed transactions, eventual consistency models.

3. **Network Latency**:
   - Delays in communication between nodes.
   - Solutions: Minimize data transfer, use efficient serialization.

#### Tools and Frameworks:
- Apache Kafka (message queuing).
- Apache Spark (distributed data processing).
- Akka (actor-based concurrency).

#### Example Use Case:
A distributed web application where tasks like request handling, database queries, and caching are distributed across multiple servers.
