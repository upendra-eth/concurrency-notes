### Actor Model
The actor model is a high-level abstraction for managing concurrency, particularly in distributed systems.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Actors**:
   - Independent entities that communicate via messages.
   - Encapsulate state and behavior.

2. **Message Passing**:
   - Actors send and receive messages asynchronously.
   - No shared state, reducing contention and race conditions.

3. **Hierarchy**:
   - Actors can create child actors, forming a supervision hierarchy.
   - Parent actors manage child actor failures.

#### Benefits:
- Simplifies concurrent and distributed programming.
- Fault-tolerant by design.
- Scales well in distributed environments.

#### Example Frameworks:
- Akka (Java/Scala): Implements the actor model for building concurrent applications.
- Erlang/Elixir: Built-in actor-based concurrency.

#### Example Use Case:
A chat application where each user is represented as an actor. Messages between users are handled via actor communication, ensuring isolation and scalability.
