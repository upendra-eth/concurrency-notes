### Process Concurrency Overview
Concurrency in operating systems refers to the ability to execute multiple processes simultaneously. This improves resource utilization and system responsiveness. Processes are independent programs that are executed by the operating system.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Concurrency vs Parallelism**:
  - Concurrency: Multiple tasks making progress simultaneously.
  - Parallelism: Multiple tasks running at the same instant on different cores.
- **Process State**: Each process transitions between states: `Ready`, `Running`, and `Waiting`.

#### Benefits of Process Concurrency:
- Better CPU utilization.
- Faster response times.
- Simplifies program design by breaking tasks into smaller processes.
