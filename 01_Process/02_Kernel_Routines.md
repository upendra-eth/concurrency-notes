### Kernel Routines for Process Management
The kernel plays a pivotal role in managing process concurrency. It ensures that processes execute smoothly without conflicts.

#### Key Functions of Kernel Routines:
1. **Process Creation and Termination**:
   - System calls like `fork()` and `exec()`.
   - Cleaning up resources on termination.
2. **Process Scheduling**:
   - Allocating CPU time to processes.
   - Balancing priorities using algorithms (Round Robin, Priority Scheduling).
3. **Interrupt Handling**:
   - Managing hardware/software interrupts.
   - Ensuring process execution is not disrupted.
4. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
   - Mechanisms like pipes, message queues, and shared memory.
