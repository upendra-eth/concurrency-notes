### Consistency Models
Consistency models define the rules for how memory operations appear to execute in a concurrent system. They are critical for designing and understanding multi-threaded applications.

#### Key Consistency Models:
1. **Strict Consistency**:
   - Every read returns the most recent write, irrespective of thread.
   - Impractical in distributed systems due to latency.

2. **Sequential Consistency**:
   - Operations appear in the same order as programmed across all threads.
   - Easier to reason about but harder to implement efficiently.

3. **Causal Consistency**:
   - Preserves cause-effect relationships between writes.
   - Writes that are causally related appear in the same order for all threads.

4. **Eventual Consistency**:
   - Guarantees that all nodes converge to the same value eventually.
   - Common in distributed systems (e.g., NoSQL databases).

5. **Weak and Release Consistency**:
   - Allow more relaxed ordering for better performance.
   - Synchronization points ensure consistency (e.g., `lock` and `unlock`).

#### Trade-offs:
- **Performance vs Predictability**: Stricter models are easier to reason about but slower.
- **Use Case Dependence**: Choose a model based on application requirements (e.g., real-time systems vs distributed databases).
