### Shared Memory
Shared memory is a concurrency model where threads or processes communicate by reading and writing to a common memory space.

#### Characteristics:
- Efficient communication with low overhead.
- Requires synchronization mechanisms to avoid conflicts (e.g., race conditions).

#### Benefits:
- Fast data sharing compared to message passing.
- Natural for applications requiring shared state (e.g., multi-threaded programs).

#### Challenges:
- **Synchronization Complexity**:
  - Requires mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and barriers.
- **Cache Coherence**:
  - Ensuring that changes in one thread's cache are visible to others.

#### Use Cases:
- Operating system kernels.
- High-performance computing (HPC) applications.
